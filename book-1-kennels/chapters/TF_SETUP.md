# Debugging Python

As a professional junior developer, you will more often be working with existing code to fix bugs, write tests, and implement small features. You will rarely be involved with writing new applications from scratch. To give you some experience with that situation, you are going to be fixing some bugs in an existing Python API project.

You will be working with two repositories. One for the client, and one for the server.

## Getting the API Project

When you are ready to take on this project, let your senior instructor know. You will be given a Github Classroom link that you can click to get a repository of code that you will be working on.

## Truncheons &amp; Flagons Client Application

The other project in the client application. You won't be fixing anything in this code base. In fact, you should not modify the code at all. You need this project running, though, to see if your bug fixes are correct.

1. Visit https://github.com/nashville-software-school/Tavern but do not clone this repo.
1. Click on the "Use this template" button at the top.
1. You can call this repo whatever you like on the next screen, but to avoid confusion, you might want to just call in Tavern.
1. Once the repo is generated on your account, then clone your repository to you machine and follow the instructions in the README.
